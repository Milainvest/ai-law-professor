# AI Law Professor - Active Context

## Current Development Phase
**Basic System Setup - Phase 1**
- Frontend setup pending
- Backend database implementation completed
- AI Service foundation completed
- Core architecture implementation

## Recent Changes
1. Database Implementation (Issue #1) completed:
   - PostgreSQL with pgvector setup
   - Entities and migrations created
   - Database schema implemented
2. AI Service foundation completed:
   - FastAPI service initialized
   - Health check endpoint implemented
   - Chat endpoint structure created
3. Frontend initialization:
   - Next.js project initialized
   - TailwindCSS configured

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Complete frontend implementation (Issue #2)
   - Implement basic chat UI components
   - Set up responsive design
   - Create authentication UI
2. Develop RAG pipeline (Issue #3)
   - Implement vector similarity search
   - Set up embedding storage
   - Create chat service
3. Implement authentication system
   - Create user registration flow
   - Set up JWT authentication
   - Implement session management

## Active Decisions
1. **Frontend Framework**: Decided on Next.js for SSR capabilities
2. **AI Service Language**: Python chosen over TypeScript for ML ecosystem
3. **Database Strategy**: PostgreSQL with pgvector extension for unified data and vector storage
4. **Deployment**: Kubernetes for orchestration

## Current Focus Areas
1. **Core Architecture**: Ensuring clean separation of concerns
2. **Legal Accuracy**: Designing validation mechanisms
3. **Performance**: Planning for low-latency responses
4. **Scalability**: Planning for concurrent user loads

## Open Questions
1. Best approach for legal citation validation?
2. Optimal RAG chunking strategy for case law?
3. User authentication requirements for law schools?

## Pending Tasks
- [ ] Implement frontend structure (Issue #2)
- [ ] Set up PostgreSQL with pgvector (Issue #1)
- [ ] Develop RAG pipeline (Issue #3)
- [ ] Create initial legal knowledge base
- [ ] Implement basic Q&A endpoint

## Current Blockers
None at this initial stage
